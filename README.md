# Quadrotor_testbed
My Bsc graduation project

The purpose of the project was angle control of a stationary 4-DOF (non-hovering) quadrotor system. The main system runs on STMF7 mc board, while the reference angle is given from a joystick with running python-ROS script externally on another pc

The control method is PID and the constants are tuned empirically (manual tuning method)
